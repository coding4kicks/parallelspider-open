                          <br>
                          In fact, there are a lot of exciting things to share about our company.&nbsp; Our story starts on November 18, 2010, when we completed the world’s largest initial public offering, emerging with a solid financial foundation that enables us to produce great vehicles for our customers and build a bright future for employees, partners and shareholders.<br>
                          <br>
                          Leading the way is our seasoned leadership team who set high standards for our company so that we can give you the best cars and trucks.&nbsp; This means that we are committed to delivering vehicles with compelling designs, flawless quality and reliability, and leading safety, fuel economy and infotainment features.&nbsp; All are intended to create that special bond that can only happen between a driver and their vehicle.<br>
                          <br>
                          Making the world’s best vehicles can only happen with the world’s greatest employees.&nbsp; We take great pride in our work, and take great care to deliver exceptional cars and a positive ownership experience to our customers around the world.<br>
                          <br>
                          We are a leader in our industry and we know the definition of success.&nbsp; Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson says it best, “We win when the customer says we win.”<br>
                          <br>
                          At the new GM, we make a strong commitment to our customers, employees, partners and other important stakeholders.&nbsp; We state proudly our five principles that guide us in everything we do:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Safety and Quality First:</b> Safety will always be a priority at GM.&nbsp; We continue to emphasize our safety-first culture in our facilities, and as we grow our business in new markets. Our safety philosophy is at the heart of the development of each vehicle. In addition to safety, delivering the highest quality vehicles is a major cornerstone of our promise to our customers.&nbsp; That is why our vehicles go through extreme testing procedures in the lab, on the road and in our production facilities prior to being offered to customers. <a href="/vision/quality_safety.html">Learn More<br>
                          </a><br>
                          </li>
<li><b>Create Lifelong Customers:</b>&nbsp; We take nothing for granted in our efforts to earn the confidence and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp; We listen to customers to make sure we are meeting their needs, and are connecting with them on their terms. Through our relationship with customers, we strive to create passionate brand advocates who love their vehicle and freely tell others about their experience.<br>
                          <br>
                          </li>
<li><b>Innovate:</b>&nbsp; We challenge ourselves to be creative and lead in everything we do.&nbsp; From implementing the smallest improvements to executing big ideas, we are constantly increasing our competitive advantage to delight and excite our customers. <a target="_blank" href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/#.html">Learn More<br>
                          </a><br>
                          </li>
<li><b>Deliver Long-Term Investment Value:</b> Our shareholders want to feel confident about their decision to invest in our company.&nbsp; By developing the world’s best vehicles, building upon our strong financial foundation, growing our business and operating with the highest level of integrity, we will continue to deliver positive results. <a href="http://investor.gm.com/#.html?evar10=gmcom_investors.html">Learn More<br>
                          </a><br>
                          </li>
<li><b>Make a Positive Difference:</b>&nbsp; We strive to make a difference in our world and in our workplace.&nbsp; Whether finding new ways to improve our business operations, achieving as part of a team or volunteering in the community, we know that our momentum is tied to positive change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
